      <p><strong>Physical fitness</strong> is used in the context of two meanings: General fitness (a state of health and well-being) and specific fitness (the ability to perform specific sports or occupational skills). Fitness can be further subdivided into five categories: Cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and body composition. The criteria for physical fitness has also expanded to include the capacity to meet physical demands in an emergency situation. Physical fitness is the capacity of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, and muscles to function at optimum efficiency. In previous years, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue. However, with increased leisure time, and changes in lifestyles wrought by the industrial revolution, which took a large proportion of the population away from farm life and into more urban areas, this definition is no longer considered comprehensive enough. The definition for physical fitness is now defined as the body’s ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, not only at a set point in time, but at various ages and stages within a person's life cycle.</p>

      <p>The key is in finding optimum health within the limits of one's lifestyle in order to be able to resist hypokinetic diseases. (Those conditions that occur as a result of a sedentary lifestyle. Examples would include obesity and complications arising from obesity, such as diabetes.)</p>

      <h4>To allow for closer evaluation, physical fitness is often divided into the following categories:</h4>
      <hr class="botm-line">  
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-7 col-xs-12">
      <p><u style="color:#000;">Cardiovascular endurance:</u> This is the ability of the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and to remove wastes over sustained periods of time. CE can be improved through aerobic exercise; those performed at a moderate level of intensity over a relatively long period of time such as running or playing tennis.</p>
      <p><u style="color:#000;">Muscular strength and endurance:</u> Strength deals with the ability of the muscle to exert force for a brief time period, while endurance is the ability of a muscle, or group of muscles, to sustain repeated contractions or to continue to apply force against an inert object. Weight training provides the means to develop both the strength and size of skeletal muscles.</p>
      <p><u style="color:#000;">Flexibility:</u> This denotes the ability to move joints and use muscles through their full range of motion. Flexibility may be increased through stretching. Hatha Yoga and pilates are whole body workouts that focus on flexibility and balance.</p>
      <p><u style="color:#000;">Body composition:</u> Composition refers to the body in terms of lean mass (muscle, bone, vital tissue, and organs) and fat mass. An optimal ratio of fat to lean mass can be determined by a person's body/mass index. A person's BMI is a more accurate method of determining whether a person's weight is healthy in relationship to their particular body type. Performing the right set of exercises can help people convert fat through increasing muscle mass.</p>

    <p>In the case of athletics, terms such as accuracy, agility, coordination power, speed, and stamina are appropriate.</p>
    <p>Many sources also cite mental and emotional health as an important part of overall fitness. This is sometimes presented as a trianglemade up of three sub-sections, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. The ideal triangle is balanced in all three areas. Like the food and nutrition pyramid designed for healthy eating, the "triangle" is in alignment with practitioners today that wish to address a more holistic approach towards health and aging.</p>
    <h4>Specific fitness requirements</h4>
    <hr class="botm-line">
    <p>Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform at a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency, for example, in sports or in military service. Specific training can prepare either an athlete or a worker in their particular field or sport.</p>
    <p>Examples of athletic training would be: Training for a 400m sprint—in which case a runner performs at ultimate speed throughout a short distance. In the case of a sprinting, the athlete must be trained to run anaerobically throughout the race. In a marathon, which covers a long distance, the athlete must be trained to work aerobically; endurance must be increased to the maximum.</p>
    <p>Anaerobic exercise is used by athletes in non-endurance sports to build power and by body builders to build muscle mass. Muscles trained under anaerobic conditions develop differently, leading to greater performance in short duration, high intensity activities, which last up to roughly two minutes. Aerobic exercise, on the other hand, includes lower intensity activities performed for longer periods of time.</p>
    <p>Firefighters and police officers must undergo regular fitness testing to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required for their jobs.</p>
    <p>In the Scouting programs of some countries, students can earn fitness badges, such as the Physical Fitness Badge which is earned in the United States by both boy and girl scouts.</p>
